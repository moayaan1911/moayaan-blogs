### Installation and Initialization

1. Install Node.js: Hardhat is built on Node.js, so the first step is to install Node.js on your local machine. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website at [**https://nodejs.org**](https://nodejs.org).
    
2. Install Hardhat: Once you have Node.js installed, you can install Hardhat using the Node Package Manager (npm) by running the following command in your terminal:
    

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

This command installs Hardhat as a development dependency in your project.

1. Initialize a Hardhat project: Once you have installed Hardhat, you can create a new Hardhat project by running the following command in your terminal:
    

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

This command creates a new Hardhat project in a new directory named `my-hardhat-project`. You can replace `my-hardhat-project` with the name of your choice.

1. Explore the project: Once the initialization is complete, you can explore the project directory by running the following command in your terminal:
    

```bash
cd my-hardhat-project
ls
```

This will change your directory to the new project directory and list the contents of the directory.

1. Here is how your folder structure will look like:-
    

```plaintext
my-hardhat-project/
├── contracts/
│   ├── .gitkeep
├── test/
│   ├── sample-test.js
├── scripts/
│   ├── sample-script.js
├── artifacts/
├── cache/
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── hardhat.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

That's it! You have now installed and initialized Hardhat on your local machine. You can start building your decentralized applications using Hardhat.

### Configuration

```apache
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.0",
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    localhost: {
      url: "http://localhost:8545",
    },
  },
};
```

Make sure your config file looks like this. In solidity version, write the version of solidity with which you are working.

### Smart Contract

In the contracts folder, delete the existing contract and create a new **.sol** file. In the file, write the following smart contract.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BasicDemo {
    uint256 private value;

    function setValue(uint256 _newValue) public {
        value = _newValue;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

This smart contract is called BasicDemo and includes two functions: `setValue` and `getValue`. The `setValue` function takes a single parameter, `_newValue`, which is used to update the `value` variable. The `getValue` function is a `view` function, which means that it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without incurring any gas costs.

To use this contract, it would need to be deployed to the Ethereum network using a tool like Hardhat or Remix. Once deployed, the `setValue` function can be called to set the value of the variable, and the `getValue` function can be called to retrieve the current value. This smart contract is very simple, but it demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of a Solidity smart contract.

### Deployment

In the scripts folder, delete the existing files and create a new **deploy.js** file. Write the following in it.

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const BasicDemo = await ethers.getContractFactory("BasicDemo");
  const basicDemo = await BasicDemo.deploy();
  await basicDemo.deployed();
  console.log("BasicDemo contract deployed to:", basicDemo.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

This script first imports the `ethers` object from the Hardhat library. It then defines an `async` function called `main` that uses the `getContractFactory` method of the `ethers` object to retrieve the factory for the `BasicDemo` smart contract. It then calls the `deploy` method on the factory to deploy the contract to the local network. Once the contract is deployed, the script logs its address to the console.

To run this script, save it to a file named `deploy.js` in the root directory of your Hardhat project, and then run the following command:

```nginx
npx hardhat run deploy.js --network localhost
```

This will deploy the BasicDemo contract to a local Hardhat network running on [`localhost`](http://localhost). If the deployment is successful, you should see the contract address logged to the console.

### Testing

In the test folder, delete the existing files and create a new **01\_test.js** file and write the following

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("BasicDemo", function () {
  let basicDemo;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    const BasicDemo = await ethers.getContractFactory("BasicDemo");
    basicDemo = await BasicDemo.deploy();
    await basicDemo.deployed();
  });

  it("should set the value", async function () {
    const newValue = 42;
    await basicDemo.setValue(newValue);
    const value = await basicDemo.getValue();
    expect(value).to.equal(newValue);
  });

  it("should get the default value", async function () {
    const defaultValue = 0;
    const value = await basicDemo.getValue();
    expect(value).to.equal(defaultValue);
  });
});
```

This script defines a test suite for the BasicDemo smart contract using the Chai assertion library. It includes two tests: one that sets the value of the contract and one that retrieves the default value.

The `describe` function defines the test suite and uses the `beforeEach` function to deploy a new instance of the BasicDemo contract before each test. This ensures that each test is executed with a fresh instance of the contract.

The first test uses the `it` function to define a test case that sets the value of the contract to 42 and then retrieves it using the `getValue` function. It uses the Chai `expect` function to assert that the retrieved value is equal to the expected value of 42.

The second test is similar, but it simply retrieves the default value of the contract (which is 0) and asserts that it is equal to the expected value of 0.

To run this script, save it to a file named `basicDemo.test.js` in the `test` directory of your Hardhat project, and then run the following command:

```apache
npx hardhat test
```

This will execute the tests in the `basicDemo.test.js` file and report the results to the console. If the tests pass, you should see a message indicating that all tests have passed.
