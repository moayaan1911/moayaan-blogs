In a shocking turn of events, Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has fallen victim to a devastating cyber attack, resulting in the theft of more than $230 million in digital assets. The incident, which occurred on July 18, 2024, has sent shockwaves through the crypto community and raised serious concerns about the security of digital asset exchanges.

## The Attack: Exploiting a Multisig Wallet Vulnerability

* Preliminary investigations suggest that the attacker exploited a mismatch between the information displayed on Liminal's interface and the actual transaction signed.
    
* The malicious payload replaced the intended transaction, effectively transferring control of the wallet to the attacker.
